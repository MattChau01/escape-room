## :gear: setup
side note: after cloning repository in VS Code, type the following in the terminal. Only need to do this once after repo is cloned.
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

AND

```shell
npm i

# OR YOU CAN USE THE FOLLOWING

npm install
```

## :running: running code

If using `React` to build components, must `run build` or `run dev`. Do this by typing the following in another terminal:
```shell
npm run dev
# THIS RUNS DEV (PAGE REFRESHES EACH TIME NEW CODE IS SAVED)


npm run build
# THIS 'RUNS THE BUILD' ONCE. IF NEW CODE IS SAVED, YOU MUST USE 'npm run build' AGAIN TO SEE UPDATES MADE
```
